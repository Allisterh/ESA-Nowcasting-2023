## The challenge {.unnumbered}

In the area of nowcasting, the European Statistics Awards Programme aims to discover promising methodologies and potential external data sources that could, now or in the future, be used to improve the timeliness of key EU economic indicators.
Better timeliness is a recurring demand for official statistics so there are obvious benefits to developing new approaches which obtain more accurate estimates within a shorter interval.
Even where a satisfactorily accurate point estimate is already available, alternative methodologies carry significant potential secondary benefits like reduced cost, improved robustness and applicability in cases where a developed statistical system is still not established.

The 2022 round of the Nowcasting awards is divided into 3 separate competitions, each focusing on the nowcasting of one economic indicator:

- **PPI**: Producer prices in industry (domestic market)
- **PVI**: Production volume in industry
- **TOURISM**: Number of nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments
