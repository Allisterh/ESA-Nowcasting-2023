  abstract={Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been the catalyst to numerous advances in a variety of fields and disciplines in recent years. Their impact on economics, however, has been comparatively muted. One type of ANN, the long short-term memory network (LSTM), is particularly wellsuited to deal with economic time-series. Here, the architecture's performance and characteristics are evaluated in comparison with the dynamic factor model (DFM), currently a popular choice in the field of economic nowcasting. LSTMs are found to produce superior results to DFMs in the nowcasting of three separate variables; global merchandise export values and volumes, and global services exports. Further advantages include their ability to handle large numbers of input features in a variety of time frequencies. A disadvantage is the inability to ascribe contributions of input features to model outputs, common to all ANNs. In order to facilitate continued applied research of the methodology by avoiding the need for any knowledge of deep-learning libraries, an accompanying Python library was developed using PyTorch, https://pypi.org/project/nowcast-lstm/.},

abstract={This paper introduces the OECD Weekly Tracker of economic activity for 46 OECD and G20 countries using Google Trends search data. The Tracker performs well in pseudo-real time simulations including around the COVID-19 crisis. The underlying model adds to the previous Google Trends literature in two respects: (1) the data are adjusted for common long-term bias and (2) the data include variables based on both Google Search categories and topics (the latter being a collection of related keywords), thus further exploiting the potential of Google Trends. The paper highlights the predictive power of specific topics, including &quot;bankruptcies&quot;, &quot;economic crisis&quot;, &quot;investment&quot;, &quot;luggage&quot; and &quot;mortgage&quot;. Calibration is performed using a neural network that captures non-linear patterns, which are shown to be consistent with economic intuition using machine learning interpretability tools (&quot;Shapley values&quot;). The tracker sheds light on the recent downturn and the dynamics of the rebound, and provides evidence about lasting shifts in consumption patterns.},

First, ARIMA models and the classical methods for fitting these models to a given time series are reviewed. Second, some objective methods for model identification are considered and some algorithmical procedures for automatic model identification are described. Third, outliers are incorporated into the model and an algorithm, for automatic model identification in the presence of outliers is proposed.},keywords = {MODELS ; TIME SERIES},url = {https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bde:wpaper:9808}}
