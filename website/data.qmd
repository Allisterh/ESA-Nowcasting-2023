We take pride in our commitment to utilizing exclusively open data sources in our modeling efforts.
This approach ensures the transparency and replicability of our methods, which are of paramount importance in the realm of official statistics.
By leveraging publicly available data, we have been able to derive accurate nowcasts of key economic indicators while promoting the principles of open science and reproducibility.
